This repository provides vulnerability reports for smart contracts, generated using multiple analysis tools on both the solidity-defects-and-bugs and the enhanced test suite. The tools used for the analysis include:
- [4naly3er](https://github.com/Picodes/4naly3er)
- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSysDiligence/mythril)
- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)
