### <a name="M-1"></a>[M-1] `call()` should be used instead of `transfer()` on an `address payable`
The use of the deprecated `transfer()` function for an address may make the transaction fail due to the 2300 gas stipend

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ChecksEffectsInteractionsTransferFixed.sol

18:         payable(msg.sender).transfer(addrBal);

```

### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ChecksEffectsInteractionsTransferFixed.sol

2: pragma solidity 0.8.17;

```

### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] Unsafe ERC20 operation(s)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ChecksEffectsInteractionsTransferFixed.sol

18:         payable(msg.sender).transfer(addrBal);

```

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] Change uint to uint256
Throughout the code base, some variables are declared as `uint`. To favor explicitness, consider changing all instances of `uint` to `uint256`

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ChecksEffectsInteractionsTransferFixed.sol

16:         uint addrBal = balance[msg.sender];

```

### <a name="NC-2"></a>[NC-2] NatSpec is completely non-existent on functions that should have them
Public and external functions that aren't view or pure should have NatSpec comments

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: ChecksEffectsInteractionsTransferFixed.sol

11:     function deposit() external payable {

15:     function withdraw() external {

```

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] Consider using named mappings
Consider moving to solidity version 0.8.18 or later, and using [named mappings](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/51629/how-to-name-the-arguments-in-mapping/145555#145555) to make it easier to understand the purpose of each mapping

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ChecksEffectsInteractionsTransferFixed.sol

9:     mapping(address => uint) private balance;

```

### <a name="NC-4"></a>[NC-4] Internal and private variables and functions names should begin with an underscore
According to the Solidity Style Guide, Non-`external` variable and function names should begin with an [underscore](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#underscore-prefix-for-non-external-functions-and-variables)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ChecksEffectsInteractionsTransferFixed.sol

9:     mapping(address => uint) private balance;

```
