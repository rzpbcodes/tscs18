### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] Cache array length outside of loop
If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration. That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: GasCostlyLoops.sol

14:         for (uint256 index = 0; index < salaries.length; index++) {

```

### <a name="GAS-2"></a>[GAS-2] For Operations that will not overflow, you could use unchecked

*Instances (4)*:
```solidity
File: GasCostlyLoops.sol

14:         for (uint256 index = 0; index < salaries.length; index++) {

16:             salary = salary - (_companyGrossSalaries[index] / 100) * 45;

22:             firstIndex++

27:                 secondIndex++

```

### <a name="GAS-3"></a>[GAS-3] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`
Variables only set in the constructor and never edited afterwards should be marked as immutable, as it would avoid the expensive storage-writing operation in the constructor (around **20 000 gas** per variable) and replace the expensive storage-reading operations (around **2100 gas** per reading) to a less expensive value reading (**3 gas**)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: GasCostlyLoops.sol

9:         _companyGrossSalaries = grossSalaries;

```

### <a name="GAS-4"></a>[GAS-4] `++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` or `i += 1` (same for `--i` vs `i--` or `i -= 1`)
Pre-increments and pre-decrements are cheaper.

For a `uint256 i` variable, the following is true with the Optimizer enabled at 10k:

**Increment:**

- `i += 1` is the most expensive form
- `i++` costs 6 gas less than `i += 1`
- `++i` costs 5 gas less than `i++` (11 gas less than `i += 1`)

**Decrement:**

- `i -= 1` is the most expensive form
- `i--` costs 11 gas less than `i -= 1`
- `--i` costs 5 gas less than `i--` (16 gas less than `i -= 1`)

Note that post-increments (or post-decrements) return the old value before incrementing or decrementing, hence the name *post-increment*:

```solidity
uint i = 1;  
uint j = 2;
require(j == i++, "This will be false as i is incremented after the comparison");
```
  
However, pre-increments (or pre-decrements) return the new value:
  
```solidity
uint i = 1;  
uint j = 2;
require(j == ++i, "This will be true as i is incremented before the comparison");
```

In the pre-increment case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning `1` instead of `2`.

Consider using pre-increments and pre-decrements where they are relevant (meaning: not where post-increments/decrements logic are relevant).

*Saves 5 gas per instance*

*Instances (3)*:
```solidity
File: GasCostlyLoops.sol

14:         for (uint256 index = 0; index < salaries.length; index++) {

22:             firstIndex++

27:                 secondIndex++

```

### <a name="GAS-5"></a>[GAS-5] Increments/decrements can be unchecked in for-loops
In Solidity 0.8+, there's a default overflow check on unsigned integers. It's possible to uncheck this in for-loops and save some gas at each iteration, but at the cost of some code readability, as this uncheck cannot be made inline.

[ethereum/solidity#10695](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

The change would be:

```diff
- for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; i++) {
+ for (uint256 i; i < numIterations;) {
 // ...  
+   unchecked { ++i; }
}  
```

These save around **25 gas saved** per instance.

The same can be applied with decrements (which should use `break` when `i == 0`).

The risk of overflow is non-existent for `uint256`.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: GasCostlyLoops.sol

14:         for (uint256 index = 0; index < salaries.length; index++) {

```

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] `constant`s should be defined rather than using magic numbers
Even [assembly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-opensea-seaport/blob/9d7ce4d08bf3c3010304a0476a785c70c0e90ae7/contracts/lib/TokenTransferrer.sol#L35-L39) can benefit from using readable constants instead of hex/numeric literals

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: GasCostlyLoops.sol

16:             salary = salary - (_companyGrossSalaries[index] / 100) * 45;

```

### <a name="NC-2"></a>[NC-2] Functions should not be longer than 50 lines
Overly complex code can make understanding functionality more difficult, try to further modularize your code to ensure readability 

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: GasCostlyLoops.sol

12:     function getNetSalariesOrdered() external view returns (uint256[] memory) {

```

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] Variables need not be initialized to zero
The default value for variables is zero, so initializing them to zero is superfluous.

*Instances (3)*:
```solidity
File: GasCostlyLoops.sol

14:         for (uint256 index = 0; index < salaries.length; index++) {

20:             uint256 firstIndex = 0;

25:                 uint256 secondIndex = 0;

```
