### <a name="M-1"></a>[M-1] Centralization Risk for trusted owners

#### Impact:
Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

25:     function withdrawFunding() external onlyOwner {

```

### <a name="M-2"></a>[M-2] `call()` should be used instead of `transfer()` on an `address payable`
The use of the deprecated `transfer()` function for an address may make the transaction fail due to the 2300 gas stipend

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

26:         payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);

```

### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Fallback lacking `payable`

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

5: contract ComplexFallbackFixed {

```

### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

2: pragma solidity 0.8.17;

```

### <a name="L-3"></a>[L-3] Unsafe ERC20 operation(s)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

26:         payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);

```

### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`
Variables only set in the constructor and never edited afterwards should be marked as immutable, as it would avoid the expensive storage-writing operation in the constructor (around **20 000 gas** per variable) and replace the expensive storage-reading operations (around **2100 gas** per reading) to a less expensive value reading (**3 gas**)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

18:         _owner = msg.sender;

```

### <a name="GAS-2"></a>[GAS-2] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

25:     function withdrawFunding() external onlyOwner {

```

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] Event missing indexed field
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible [to off-chain tools](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/40396/can-somebody-please-explain-the-concept-of-event-indexing) that parse events. This is especially useful when it comes to filtering based on an address. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Where applicable, each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three applicable fields, all of the applicable fields should be indexed.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

7:     event newDoner(address doner);

```

### <a name="NC-2"></a>[NC-2] NatSpec is completely non-existent on functions that should have them
Public and external functions that aren't view or pure should have NatSpec comments

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: ComplexFallbackFixed.sol

25:     function withdrawFunding() external onlyOwner {

```

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] Event is missing `indexed` fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.
