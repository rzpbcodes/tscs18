### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Division by zero not prevented
The divisions below take an input parameter which does not have any zero-value checks, which may lead to the functions reverting when zero is passed.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: DivideByZeroDirectFixed.sol

11:         return number1 / number2 + 1;

```

### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity

2: pragma solidity 0.8.17;

```

### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] For Operations that will not overflow, you could use unchecked

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: DivideByZeroDirectFixed.sol

11:         return number1 / number2 + 1;

```

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: DivideByZeroDirectFixed.sol

6:     function divide(uint256 number1, uint256 number2)

```
