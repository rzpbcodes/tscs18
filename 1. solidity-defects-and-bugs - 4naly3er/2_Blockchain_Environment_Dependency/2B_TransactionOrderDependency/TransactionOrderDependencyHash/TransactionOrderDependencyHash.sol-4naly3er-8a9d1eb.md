### <a name="M-1"></a>[M-1] `call()` should be used instead of `transfer()` on an `address payable`
The use of the deprecated `transfer()` function for an address may make the transaction fail due to the 2300 gas stipend

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

14:             payable(msg.sender).transfer(prize);

```

### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

2: pragma solidity 0.8.17;

```

### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] Unsafe ERC20 operation(s)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

14:             payable(msg.sender).transfer(prize);

```

### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated
When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly bypasses this loop. 

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gas-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one. 

 *Saves 60 gas per instance*

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

12:     function guess(bytes memory g) public {

```

### <a name="GAS-2"></a>[GAS-2] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`
Variables only set in the constructor and never edited afterwards should be marked as immutable, as it would avoid the expensive storage-writing operation in the constructor (around **20 000 gas** per variable) and replace the expensive storage-reading operations (around **2100 gas** per reading) to a less expensive value reading (**3 gas**)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

9:         prize = msg.value;

```

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] Default Visibility for constants
Some constants are using the default visibility. For readability, consider explicitly declaring them as `internal`.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

5:     bytes32 constant TO_GUESS = 0x3350d745acd40b6a232b0266fe40c74a81ac78c31f48c00f5714ba6769cbc374;

```

### <a name="NC-2"></a>[NC-2] Change uint to uint256
Throughout the code base, some variables are declared as `uint`. To favor explicitness, consider changing all instances of `uint` to `uint256`

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

6:     uint private prize;

```

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] NatSpec is completely non-existent on functions that should have them
Public and external functions that aren't view or pure should have NatSpec comments

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

12:     function guess(bytes memory g) public {

```

### <a name="NC-4"></a>[NC-4] Internal and private variables and functions names should begin with an underscore
According to the Solidity Style Guide, Non-`external` variable and function names should begin with an [underscore](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#underscore-prefix-for-non-external-functions-and-variables)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

6:     uint private prize;

```

### <a name="NC-5"></a>[NC-5] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TransactionOrderDependencyHash.sol

12:     function guess(bytes memory g) public {

```
