### <a name="M-1"></a>[M-1] Centralization Risk for trusted owners

#### Impact:
Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

27:     function startGame() external onlyOwner {

```

### <a name="M-2"></a>[M-2] `call()` should be used instead of `transfer()` on an `address payable`
The use of the deprecated `transfer()` function for an address may make the transaction fail due to the 2300 gas stipend

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

38:             payable(msg.sender).transfer(10 * fee);

```

### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

2: pragma solidity 0.8.17;

```

### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] Unsafe ERC20 operation(s)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

38:             payable(msg.sender).transfer(10 * fee);

```

### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] For Operations that will not overflow, you could use unchecked

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

29:         _gameEndTime = _gameStartTime + 15 seconds;

38:             payable(msg.sender).transfer(10 * fee);

```

### <a name="GAS-2"></a>[GAS-2] Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas

Additionally, custom errors can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).

Source: <https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/>:

> Starting from [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4), there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., `revert("Insufficient funds.");`), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Consider replacing **all revert strings** with custom errors in the solution, and particularly those that have multiple occurrences:

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

34:         require(msg.value >= fee, "You must pay the fee required to play");

```

### <a name="GAS-3"></a>[GAS-3] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`
Variables only set in the constructor and never edited afterwards should be marked as immutable, as it would avoid the expensive storage-writing operation in the constructor (around **20 000 gas** per variable) and replace the expensive storage-reading operations (around **2100 gas** per reading) to a less expensive value reading (**3 gas**)

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

23:         _owner = msg.sender;

24:         fee = _fee;

```

### <a name="GAS-4"></a>[GAS-4] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

27:     function startGame() external onlyOwner {

```

### <a name="GAS-5"></a>[GAS-5] Superfluous event fields
`block.timestamp` and `block.number` are added to event information by default so adding them manually wastes gas

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

12:     event GameStarted(uint256 timestamp);

```

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] `constant`s should be defined rather than using magic numbers
Even [assembly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-opensea-seaport/blob/9d7ce4d08bf3c3010304a0476a785c70c0e90ae7/contracts/lib/TokenTransferrer.sol#L35-L39) can benefit from using readable constants instead of hex/numeric literals

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

29:         _gameEndTime = _gameStartTime + 15 seconds;

```

### <a name="NC-2"></a>[NC-2] Control structures do not follow the Solidity Style Guide
See the [control structures](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#control-structures) section of the Solidity Style Guide

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

35:         if (

```

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] Event missing indexed field
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible [to off-chain tools](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/40396/can-somebody-please-explain-the-concept-of-event-indexing) that parse events. This is especially useful when it comes to filtering based on an address. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Where applicable, each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three applicable fields, all of the applicable fields should be indexed.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

12:     event GameStarted(uint256 timestamp);

```

### <a name="NC-4"></a>[NC-4] NatSpec is completely non-existent on functions that should have them
Public and external functions that aren't view or pure should have NatSpec comments

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: TimestampDependency.sol

27:     function startGame() external onlyOwner {

33:     function play() external payable returns (bool) {

```

### <a name="NC-5"></a>[NC-5] Event is missing `indexed` fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.
