### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

```solidity

### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas

Additionally, custom errors can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).

> Starting from [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4), there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., `revert("Insufficient funds.");`), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Consider replacing **all revert strings** with custom errors in the solution, and particularly those that have multiple occurrences:

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: SendReturnValueNotCheckedFixed.sol

15:             revert("Withdraw failed");

```

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] Change uint to uint256
Throughout the code base, some variables are declared as `uint`. To favor explicitness, consider changing all instances of `uint` to `uint256`

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: SendReturnValueNotCheckedFixed.sol

12:         uint amount = balanceOf[msg.sender];

```

### <a name="NC-2"></a>[NC-2] `mapping` definitions do not follow the Solidity Style Guide
See the [mappings](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#mappings) section of the Solidity Style Guide

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: SendReturnValueNotCheckedFixed.sol

5:     mapping (address=>uint) balanceOf;

```

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] NatSpec is completely non-existent on functions that should have them
Public and external functions that aren't view or pure should have NatSpec comments

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: SendReturnValueNotCheckedFixed.sol

7:     function deposit() public payable {

11:     function withdraw() public {

```

### <a name="NC-4"></a>[NC-4] Internal and private variables and functions names should begin with an underscore
According to the Solidity Style Guide, Non-`external` variable and function names should begin with an [underscore](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#underscore-prefix-for-non-external-functions-and-variables)

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: SendReturnValueNotCheckedFixed.sol

5:     mapping (address=>uint) balanceOf;

```

### <a name="NC-5"></a>[NC-5] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: SendReturnValueNotCheckedFixed.sol

7:     function deposit() public payable {

11:     function withdraw() public {

```
